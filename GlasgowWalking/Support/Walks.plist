				<string>To ensure fair trading by merchants, shopkeepers, surveyors, architects and builders, strict standards of measurement were prominently provided in public places during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In the days before metrication, every child had to learn that three feet makes a yard, 22 yards make a chain, 10 chains make a furlong and eight furlongs make a mile! There are three sets of measurement standards which remain on view in George Square to this day:1. The standard inch, foot, two-feet and three-feet measurements2. There is a standard chain measure3. There is a 100-feet measure located at the west side of the north lawn.Following the Treaty of Union with England in 1706, the traditional Scots measurement units of Фells, falls and milesХ were legally replaced with the English measurement system, however, they continued in use in some areas of Scotland into the 20th century.</string>
